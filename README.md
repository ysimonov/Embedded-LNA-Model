# Embedded-LNA-Model

Before using this script, unarchive Directivity.rar in Data/Directivity/ foulder.

Usage:
1. Specify theta, phi source pointing
2. Specify how many degrees were used during the simulation, assuming equal spacing in phi and theta directions
3. Provide gridpoint number for creation of beamformer coefficients

The model is limited due to homogeneous sky approximation, and may not reflect the real solution.
