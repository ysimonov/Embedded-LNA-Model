# Embedded-LNA-Model

Before using this script, unarchive Directivity.rar in Data/Directivity/ foulder.

Usage:
1. Specify theta, phi source pointing
2. Specify how many degrees were used during the simulation for phi and theta directions
3. Provide gridpoint number for creation of beamformer coefficients

The limitations of this model:
1. Homogeneous sky approximation
2. Radiation efficiency is unknown (assumption is made)
